# Data structure

The data is organized into two pickle files for the throughput analysis, and four MATLAB files for the noise analysis. See [this file](data_analysis_code/data-readme.md) for more information.

# Source code structure

The source code for the switching framework can be found in the [switching-framework](switching-framework) folder. We provide Python scripts to query the [n2yo](https://n2yo.com) APIs, track the AURA satellite, and trigger switch commands to the SPDT switch of the dual-band backhaul prototype. The source code to elaborate the data and generate the paper figures is in the [data_analysis_code](data_analysis_code) folder.
